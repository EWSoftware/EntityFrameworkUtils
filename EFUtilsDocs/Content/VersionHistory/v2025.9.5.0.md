Changes made in this release:


- Updated the [](@T:EWSoftware.EntityFramework.DataAnnotations.IgnoreAttribute)
so that it can be applied to classes and structures along with a property name to ignore inherited properties that
are not accessible and cannot have the attribute applied to them directly.
- Added a new [](@M:EWSoftware.EntityFramework.DatabaseExtensions.GetMethodInfo(Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext)){prefer-overload="true"}
data context extension method to get the stored procedure method information regardless of whether the method is
called synchronously or asynchronously.
- Updated the conversion utility to make use of the `GetMethodInfo`
extension method.
