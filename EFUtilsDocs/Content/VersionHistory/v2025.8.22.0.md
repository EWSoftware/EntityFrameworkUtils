Changes made in this release:


- Fixed the `ContinueAwait` setting in the `DeleteEntityAsync`
method.
- Updated `ChangeTrackingEntity` to use
`EqualityComparer<T>.Default.Equals` rather than `Object.Equals`
when checking for a changed field value.
- Changed the constraint on all methods that operate on tracked entities from
`ChangeTrackingEntity` to `class, INotifyPropertyChanged`.  This
allows the methods to work with any type that implements property change notification such as
`ObservableObject` in the Community Toolkit MVVM NuGet package.
- Added a new */useCommunityMvvm* command line option to the DBML
conversion utility.  When specified, generated entity classes that require change tracking will derive from
`ObservableObject` from the Community Toolkit MVVM NuGet package.  Values in the
entity classes will be marked with the `ObservableProperty` attribute and written out
using field syntax.
